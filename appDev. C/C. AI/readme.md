* ### Simulated Annealing
---
Simulated annealing, or modeling of systematic cooling of a molten 
metal to a solid. The theoretical N-Queens problem is used to demonstrate 
the constraint satisfaction properties of the algorithm.

* ### Adaptive Resonance Theory
---
Adaptive Resonance Theory, also called ART-1, is a clustering algorithm 
that provides the ability to separate (or cluster) elements in a data 
set into independent data sets based upon properties of the individual 
data items. The algorithm does this in an unsupervised manner, allowing 
the algorithm to find patterns in the data that a user may not notice. 
The practical problem of personalization is used to demonstrate ART1 
in the context of a recommender system.

* ### Ant Algorithms
---
Ant algorithms are a relatively new method that can be used to identify 
optimal paths through a graph. Ant algorithms model the movement of ants
within an environment and use simulated pheromone to communicate with other ants
(the process of stigmatise). The theoretical problem of the Traveling Salesman Problem 
(or TSP) is used to demonstrate the ant algorithm.

* ### Backpropagation Algorithm
---
The backpropagation algorithm, is one of the primary methods used to train 
multi-layer neural networks given a training set and a set of desired outputs.
Backpropagation propagates errors back through the nodes of a network, altering 
the weights of the connections based upon the error of the actual and desired outputs.
The interesting problem of training game neuron controllers (game AI) is used 
to demonstrate backpropagation. Given a simple neural network, a set 
of environmental inputs and a set of allowable actions (otherwise known 
as the training set), the algorithm trains the network to perform the 
desired action for the current environment. It is then demonstrated 
that the neuron controller is able to generalize and perform useful 
behaviors for unforeseen environments.

* ### Genetic Algorithms / Genetic Programming
---
Genetic algorithms provide a novel optimization technique that can 
be applied to both numerical and symbolic problems. The subfield of
Genetic programming is further used to illustrate the creation of 
instruction sequences to solve problems in code generation. 
Sequences of instructions are evolved to solve 
mathematical functions, and it is demonstrated how these sequences 
can find novel strings that are both interesting and optimal given a 
simple virtual machine.

* ### Artificial Life / Evolving Neural Networks
---
Artificial life is studied here in the context of neural networks 
through evolution of simple organisms in a synthetic environment. 
Organisms survive through successfully 
existing within their environment, avoiding prey and foraging for 
food. Organisms are permitted to reproduce, once they reach a high 
enough level of internal energy. Therefore, reproduction is only 
permitted if organisms can survive within the environment, which 
should lead to more fit organisms. The organisms are provided with 
multi-layer neural networks as their neuron controllers, and given two 
different types of organisms, illustrate simple food-web organizations.

* ### Expert Systems
---
Rules-based systems, which emphasis and 
implementation of a forward-chaining system. Varieties of examples 
are provided, in the form of rules and initial facts, with a final 
example of embedded the rules-based system into an embedded system 
and utilizing it for sensor fault-tolerance.

* ### Fuzzy Logic
---
Fuzzy logic and fuzzy control are described including 
an implementation of a fuzzy API for inclusion into other applications. 
The API provides not only the standard fuzzy operators, but also helper 
functions that support the simple creation of fuzzy membership 
functions. Example is a simple battery charger.

* ### Hidden Markov Models
---
Hidden Markov models, which are networks 
that include states and transitions with associated probabilities. The 
outcome, or observation, of a state is generated based upon the 
associated probability distribution. The action is performed, made 
visible, though the internal state is hidden, thus the hidden aspect of 
the Markov model. Hidden Markov models have a variety of applications; 
we look at the generation of meaningful text based upon 
training by a corpus.

* ### Intelligent Agents
---
Intelligent agents, with emphasis 
on search and filtering agents. Intelligent agents are applied in a 
number of different ways; the application chosen for this chapter is a 
filtering agent that acts as an intermediary to UseNet sites on the 
Internet. The WebAgent is configured through a simple configuration 
file. It then autonomously gathers news using the NNTP protocol and 
presents it to the user with the HTTP protocol (acting as a simple web 
server).
