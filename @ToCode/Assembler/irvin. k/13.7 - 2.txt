; 13.7 - 2 - Longest Increasing Sequence(ONLY ASM)

; This program looks for a longest sequence of increasing numbers in a given array.
; [i + 1] is compared to[i], increasing counter until[i + 1] < [i]. Value of counter and position of[i] are saved.
; Comparison is repeated again until[i + 1] <[i]. Current counter is compared to previously saved value, 
;if current value is bigger, then value of counter and position of[i] are re-saved.
