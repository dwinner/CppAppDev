string byte 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j'; source of letters
string1 byte 10 dup(0)

.code
main PROC

; we will manipulate the value of esp later
;we return this value back to esp just before the exit
mov edi, esp

; this block push all the letters from source to stack

mov esi, 0
mov ecx, lengthof string
L1 :
movzx eax, string[esi]
push eax
inc esi
loop L1

; this block generates some number in range between 0 and number of letters of stack.
; It will determine the lenghth of random string1

mov eax, 10; number of letters in stack
call RandomRange

mov ebx, esp; later we will manipulate esp value, that s why we have to save the value of esp

mov ecx, eax
mov esi, 0
L2:
mov esp, ebx; value of esp points to the top of letters in stack
mov eax, 10; here we choose randomly some letter from stack
call RandomRange
mov edx, type dword
mul edx; multiplication is actually eax*edx, but eax is never mentioned
add esp, eax; now esp points to random letter in stack
pop eax
sub eax, 32; popped letter is in lower case.Difference between upper and lower case in ASCII is 32
mov string1[esi], al; letter in string1 is in upper case
inc esi
loop L2

mov esp, edi

exit

; INVOKE ExitProcess, 0

main ENDP

; we could create a procedure to debug this program faster.
; PushStack proc works well, but some unknown error is generated later, precisely eax gets in L2 some strane values.
; Thus we prefer to work without supplementary procedures

PushStack proc
mov ebx, esp; we have to save esp value before implementing push command
mov esi, 0
mov ecx, lengthof string
L1:
movzx eax, string[esi]
push eax
inc esi
loop L1
mov edx, esp; here edx will point to the top of letters in stack
mov esp, ebx; now esp points to return address of procedure
ret
PushStack endp
