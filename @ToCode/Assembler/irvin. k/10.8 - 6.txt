; 10.8 - 6 - mWriteInt Macro(modified version, see below)

; This macro asks user to enter some integer and then specify it s size
; (0 for WORD, 1 for DWORD).Depending on specified size, the integer is saved
; in corresponding memory operand.

; THIS PROGRAM PERMITS ASSEMBLY, BUT DOESN T WORK CORRECTLY!
; Unfortunately, if / ifidn directives are checked in ASSEMBLY TIME, not in RUNTIME.
; it means, that expression(ifidn <eax>, <0>) should know the content of eax before ASSEMBLY TIME.
;Since this value is unknown, only expression following (else) is taken in account.
