; 10.8 - 10 - Three - Operand Instructions

; Modification of previously composed mDIV3 macro.

; Current program performs division using shifting instruction.
;Explanation:
; Input array:
; x sdword a, b - dividend
; y sdword c, d - divisor
; First combination of SHLD B, SHL A instructions is performed until first significant bite is encountered.
; Counter of the loop(n) indicates position of this bite, thus we assume that B + A = 2 ^ n.
; The same operation is performed with divisor, if counter is(m), then C + D = 2 ^ m.
; Thus, product of division can be calculated as 2 ^ (n - m).
