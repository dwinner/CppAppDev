; 8.11 - 3 - Blinking chess table

; This is a modification of previous program;
; The idea was to simplify the program, removing SetColor2 subroutine.
; and simply carrying the coloured row to the next line.
; The program checks whether the lenghth of line is equal to set value
; and then move the row to the next line.

;!!!THIS PROGRAM WORKS ONLY WHEN THE NUMBER OF SQUARES IS ODD (3, 5, 7, etc).
