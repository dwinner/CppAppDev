Code Examples: C in a Nutshell, 2nd Edition
------------------------------------------- 

This folder contains the numbered examples from the book
"C in a Nutshell", 2nd edition, by Peter Prinz and Tony Crawford,
ISBN: 978-1-491-90475-6 (O'Reilly 2016). These examples are provided
"as is" for demonstration purposes; we make no representations and
assume no liability whatsoever in connection with them.

To compile the programs, see the section "Compiling C Programs with GCC"
in Chapter 19 of the book. For compiling and debugging under a graphical
interface, see the section "IDEs for C" in Chapter 22.

Note that GCC does not support all the features of the C11 standard. To
our knowledge, there is at present only one generally available C
compiler that claims to do so, namely Pelles C for Windows (see
http://www.smorgasbordet.com/pellesc/index.htm).
